# Spotify-Songs-Genre-Segmentation
Abstract
This project aims to classify songs from Spotify into different genres using machine learning techniques. We will use a publicly available dataset that contains various features of Spotify tracks, preprocess the data, train several classification models, and evaluate their performance. The best-performing model will be used to predict the genre of new songs.

1. Introduction
Music streaming services like Spotify host vast libraries of songs from various genres. Classifying these songs into genres helps improve user experience by enabling better recommendations and playlist creation. In this project, we will use machine learning to automatically classify songs into genres based on their audio features.

2. Existing System
Current systems for genre classification often rely on manual tagging by users or music experts. These methods are time-consuming and may not scale well with the growing number of songs. Machine learning offers a scalable and efficient alternative by learning patterns from the audio features of songs.

3. Proposed System
We propose using machine learning models to classify songs into genres based on their audio features. We will explore various algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM). The system will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
